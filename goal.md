Time Tracker
25/05/2024

What's the plan?
- Automatically track time spent on apps and sites

What's the deal?
1. differentiate between different projects (ie might be working in the same app for different projects)
2. differentiate between sites

What's the focus?
1. track time spent in vs code
2. track time spent in chrome

What's the checklist?
- [X] eye on what's happening (wya)
  - [X] need to see what website
  - [X] need to see what app
- [X] start timer when an app or site is opened
- [X] save data to a json file
- [X] run in the background
